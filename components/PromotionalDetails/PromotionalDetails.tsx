          PART 2: PROMOTION DETAILS
        </h2>
        <p>
          The following contains facts, figures, explanations, annotations, full
          testimonials, and other resources about the promotional piece you just
          viewed. In short, these are the resources used to put together the
          previous promotion. As you have seen, we publish testimonials in our
          promotions. All of those testimonials are the words of real
          subscribers that we received in real letters, emails, and other
          feedback. If a subscriber sends a testimonial we would like to use in
          a promotion, a member of our Customer Service team calls them to
          verify their claims. We do not make these results up, and we do not
          pay or compensate subscribers for their testimonials.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we receive testimonials from a subscriber, we veil their last
          name and any identifying details to protect their privacy and
          identity. During the verification process, we will often ask for
          particulars about the subscriber's results, including:
        </p>
        {/* list */}
        <ol type="1">
          <li>How much money he or she invested,</li>
          <li>How long he or she was in the trade,</li>
          <li>
            How much the subscriber made in dollars terms and as a percentage of
            the original investment, and
          </li>
          <li>
            What portion of his or her overall portfolio was put into the trade.
          </li>
        </ol>
        {/* block 2 */}
        <p>
          We ask these questions because we want a clearer picture of the
          results that the subscriber attained so that we can pass that
          information on to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should keep these questions in mind when assessing whether to
          purchase our products and whether you could obtain similar results.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the subscriber does not give us this information, then we cannot
          publish it. We publish this information to let you know that these
          results are possible and have been achieved by real people after
          reading our research. However, you should also understand that we are
          advertising these testimonials because they are atypical. These
          results are examples of the very best possible outcomes.
        </p>
        <p className="underline">
          Past results like these are no guarantee of any future result.
        </p>
        <p>
          We would not recommend anticipating such outstanding results with your
          own investments. Yes, you could have results like these – or perhaps
          even better. But it is simply not prudent to assume you will
          immediately make large investment returns. Instead, we urge you to
          read our work carefully, to follow our risk management strategies
          conscientiously, and to invest cautiously while setting expectations
          that are based around our long-term performance average
        </p>
        <p>
          What follows are the facts, figures, resources, and full testimonials
          from the accompanying promotion for TradeKK.

        <p>
          Please note we are not detailing all biographical information to
          protect the privacy and safety of our Analyst’s and their families. We
          will also keep proprietary information about our company private.
          Biographical and company-specific claims, as well as all other
          material details in this promotion, have been reviewed for accuracy
          and transparency by our in-house legal team.
